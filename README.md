# Dex Reader

Basic MangaDex reader built on the new MangaDex v5 api with Flutter.

Note: Both this app and the api it is built on are pretty buggy and are liable to break without warning.

To build: Make sure you have flutter >v2 sdk and the Android sdk installed.
Download this repository, and run the build command with `flutter build apk`.

Unfortunately because of CORS this won't work as a web app without some more tweaking :(.
